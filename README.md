# Burglar-Detector


Residential burglary is when someone breaks
into an occupied home without permission and
plans to steal. Even though the number of
burglaries has decreased worldwide in the last 20
years, it is still a common crime. Most people
will become victims of a burglary at some point.
Burglary is a property crime, but for many
families of burglary victims, the fact that
someone broke into their home is more
important than the property they lose. Many
victims contacted the police. The police, victims,
and offenders contribute to our understanding of
burglary.
Recently, burglary detection has become
more popular because it can be used in many
ways and because of new scientific discoveries.
Academics have done much research on the
detection task, and it has real-world uses like
crime detection, face detection, vehicle
detection, and burglary detection. Object
detection methods have evolved quickly because
of many different factors and efforts. Two of
these are the improvement of Yolo (you only
look once) and the power of Nvidia GeForce
computation. Deep learning methods are now
used by almost everyone in areas like domainspecific and general object detection that are
specific to deep learning and computer vision.
Deep learning networks are at the heart of the
most advanced object detectors and are also used
to find things. Every day, more burglaries and
more burglars are causing many people to worry
about security. So, the primary goal of this
investigation is to determine who is breaking
into homes in residential areas. Most homes and
public places now use new technologies,
primarily video surveillance, to stop burglaries
